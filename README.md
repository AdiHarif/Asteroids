We started this project back in 2020, during the 3rd year of our undergrad studies. This game was developed as part of a 24 hours long marathon, as a fun, casual and educational project.

Almost three years later, we decided to revive it as a side project. We keep enhance and maintain the game as a hobby on our free time.
